20190213 go语言多线程不支持mnt namespace再次挂载
   原因前提在3.10.0 kernel下systemd启动的docker服务设置选项MountFlags=slave为解决nginx及系统ntp等服务systemd启动时开启了privateTmp=true，共享问题

   docker 在CentOS Linux release 7.3.1611 (Core) 3.10.0-514.6.2.el7.x86_64 环境时
   升级kernel 支持fs.may_detach_mounts = 1  v4.13+ kernels   docker 17.12版本开始支持overlay2

20190214 runc暂不支持cgroup v2
   Our current cgroup parsing logic assumes cgroup v1 mounts
   so we should ignore cgroup2 mounts for now

difference between du and df 
1.The file system allocates some of the disk blocks in the file system to record its data. This data is referred to as meta data. Meta data is not visible to most user-level programs. Examples of meta data are inodes, disk maps, indirect blocks, and super blocks.
du is an example of a user-level program that is not aware of file system meta data, while df looks at the file system disk allocation maps and is aware of file system meta data. df obtains the true file system statistics, whereas du sees only a partial picture. For example, an empty 4MB JFS file system created with frag=4096 and nbpi=4096 has the following meta data allocated:
  
2.Another example that contributes to a difference between du and df is the following:
If someone is running an application with a file open in a directory and the open file is removed, the du output reflects a reduced size for this directory. However, df does not show a reduced size because all blocks in the file system remain allocated until the application that has the file open closes the file. After the file closure, df shows reduced usage for the file system.
